import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Follow the instructions in this topic to install the Rust crates (packages) required to interact with Sui networks, including the Sui CLI.

The steps to install Sui include:

1.  Install [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for your operating system.
1.  Install [Sui binaries](#install-sui-binaries).
1.  Configure an [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](#integrated-development-environment).
1.  Request [SUI test tokens](#sui-tokens) to use on Sui Devnet or Sui Testnet networks.

You can also download the [source code](#source-code) to have local access to files.

## Sui repository {#sui-repository}

The Sui repository includes primary branches, `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, and `main`.

- The `devnet` branch includes the latest stable build of Sui. Choose the `devnet` branch if you want to build or test on Sui Devnet. If you encounter an issue or find a bug, it may already be fixed in the `main` branch. To submit a pull request (PR), you should push commits to your fork of the `main` branch.
- The `testnet` branch includes the code running on the Sui Testnet network.
- The `mainnet` branch includes the code running on the Sui Mainnet network.
- The `main` branch includes the most recent changes and updates. Use the `main` branch if you want to contribute to the Sui project. The `main` branch may include unreleased changes, or introduce changes that cause issues in apps created using an earlier version.

## Supported operating systems {#supported-operating-systems}

Sui supports the following operating systems:

- Linux - Ubuntu version 20.04 (Bionic Beaver)
- macOS - macOS Monterey
- Microsoft Windows - Windows 11

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Your system needs the following prerequisites available to successfully install Sui.

### Rust and Cargo {#rust-and-cargo}

Sui requires Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager) on all supported operating systems. The suggested method to install Rust is with `rustup` using cURL.

Some other commands in the installation instructions also require cURL to run. If you can't run the cURL command to install Rust, see the instructions to install cURL for your operating system in the following section before you install Rust.

Use the following command to install Rust and Cargo on macOS or Linux:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows 11, see information about using the [Rust installer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website. The installer checks for C++ build tools and prompts you to install them if necessary. Select the option that best defines your environment and follow the instructions in the install wizard.

For additional installation options, see [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Sui uses the latest version of Cargo to build and manage dependencies. See the [Cargo installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) page on the Rust website for more information.

Use the following command to update Rust with `rustup`:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

Install the prerequisites listed in this section. Use the following command to update `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

#### All Linux prerequisites

Reference the relevant sections that follow to install each prerequisite individually, or run the following to install them all at once:

* Git CLI
* CMake
* C++ build tools
* LLVM compiler

#### cURL {#curl-2}

#### Protocol Buffers {#protocol-buffers}

Download [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) (protoc-xx.x-win32.zip or protoc-xx.x-win64.zip) and add the \bin directory to your Windows PATH environment variable.

#### Additional tools for Windows {#additional-tools-windows}

Sui requires the following additional tools on computers running Windows.

- For Windows on ARM64 only - [Visual Studio 2022 Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/).
- [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) is required to [install Rust](#rust-and-cargo).
- The [LLVM Compiler Infrastructure](https://releases.llvm.org/). Look for a file with a name similar to LLVM-15.0.7-win64.exe for 64-bit Windows, or LLVM-15.0.7-win32.exe for 32-bit Windows.

**Known issue** - The `sui console` command does not work in PowerShell.

## Install Sui binaries {#install-sui-binaries}

Run the following command to install Sui binaries from the `devnet` branch:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --branch devnet sui
```

The install process can take a while to complete. You can monitor installation progress in the terminal. If you encounter an error, make sure to install the latest version of all prerequisites and then try the command again.

To update to the latest stable version of Rust:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

The command installs Sui components in the `~/.cargo/bin` folder.

### Confirm the installation {#confirm-the-installation}

To confirm that Sui installed correctly, type `sui` and press Enter. You should see a message about the Sui version installed and help for using Sui commands.

## Integrated development environment {#integrated-development-environment}

The recommended IDE for Move development is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the move-analyzer extension. Follow the Visual Studio Marketplace instructions to install the [move-analyzer extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=move.move-analyzer), then install the move-analyzer language server passing `address32` using the `--features` flag and passing `sui-move` to the `branch` flag:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/move-language/move move-analyzer --branch sui-move --features "address32"
```

See more [IDE options](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move#ides) in the [Awesome Move](https://github.com/MystenLabs/awesome-move) documentation.

## SUI tokens {#sui-tokens}

You need SUI tokens to perform transactions on a Sui network. You can get test tokens from the Sui faucet in Discord, in the [Sui Wallet](https://github.com/MystenLabs/mysten-app-docs/blob/main/mysten-sui-wallet.mdx), or using a network faucet.

To learn more about requesting test SUI tokens, see Requesting Gas Tokens from Faucet.
